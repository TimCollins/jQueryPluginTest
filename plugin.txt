$("a").css("color", "red");

What happens for the above JavaScript?
Use the shorthand definition for the jQuery function, passing a selector which retrieves all anchor elements (a) in the DOM.
The function will return a jQuery object which supports all built-in functions like css, click, each and a set of matching the selector.
The css() function is then called on that set of objects and passed two string parameters.

For a jQuery plugin to work, its functionality must also be accessible to $.fn().
This is done by extending the $.fn() e.g. with a new function. 
Create a function called greenify which turns links green.
	$.fn.greenify = function() {
		this.css("color", "green");
	};

	
Note that "this" is used rather than "$(this)" because an object will have already been selected and is that object that the css() function is to be called on. Wrapping it in another call to jQuery is unnecessary. 

Many jQuery functions can be chained together such that a number of actions are linked to one selector e.g. $("p").first().html("<span>" + text + "</span>"); gets a set of paragraph objects from the DOM, reduces the set to the first one encountered and then sets the HTML of the element to that specified by the html() call.
To allow a function to be chained, return the object from the function once whatever desired operation has taken place. For the greenify function above, this is a case of adding "return this;" as the last line of the function.

The "$" alias is a common shorthand which is not exclusive to jQuery plugins. To work with other plugins and still use "$" an immediately-invoked function expression should be used.
This is a design pattern where an function expression is declared and immediately executed. This can be placed in a function e.g. a button click or just dropped into a .js file and it will be executed. The output variable will not be accessible outside the function. 

(function () {
    var output = "This will be logged to the browser console.";
    console.log(output);
})();


This is the greenify function wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression:
// Declare a function with one parameter, "$", and pass it the jQuery function object.
(function($) {
    $.fn.greenify = function () {
        this.css("color", "#00FF00");
        return this;
    };
}(jQuery));

It is recommended to use function parameters with plugins to reduce the chance of one plugin interfering with another. I think that if the function signatures are different then even if the function names are the same, they won't upset each other. Not sure about this.

The jQuery.extend() function is used to merge the contents of two or more objects together. It can be used to provide default values for plugin settings. This code creates an anonymous object with two properties and then merges it with the named object options which has been passed to the function. The merge is done right-to left so anything specified in options will overwrite the defaults. Conversely if something is not specified in options then the default value will remain.
	var settings = $.extend({
		color: "#00FF00",
		backgroundColor: "white"
	}, options);


It's also possible to modify the jQuery object itself by providing only one parameter to extend().


If the settings are declared in a named object so that it's a property of the plugin then the defaults can be changed outside of the plugin itself. In that case we would end up with something like:
	var settings = $.extend({}, $.fn.greenify.defaults, options);

Here the options variable passed into the function is merged with the defaults object. The result of that merge is then merged into an empty object and the result saved to a variable called settings as above.

It's possible to alter the default settings outside the plugin call then:
	$.fn.greenify.defaults.backgroundColor = "blue";

The existing functionality which allowed an anonymous object to be passed to the plugin remains unchanged:
	$("a").greenify({ backgroundColor: "orange" });


Functions that are publicly-defined can be overridden before use. It seems like functions are publicly-defined when they are part of the same namespace e.g. the two functions below can be accessed outside the block.
(function($) {
    $.fn.showLinkLocation = function () {
		...
		this.filter("a").append(function () {        
            return $.fn.showLinkLocation.format(" (" + this.href + ")");
        });
		...
    };

    // Define a format function to make text bold.
    $.fn.showLinkLocation.format = function (text) {
        ...
    };
}(jQuery));

By contrast, the debug method below can't be changed. It seems that it can be accessed but the default implementation can't be changed.

(function($) {
    $.fn.greenify = function (options) {
        var settings = $.extend({}, $.fn.greenify.defaults, options);
		...
        debug(settings);
		...
    };

    function debug(obj) {
        if (window.console && window.console.log) {
            console.log("Changed links to background '" + obj.backgroundColor +
                "' and foreground '" + obj.color + "'.");
        }
    };

}(jQuery));
	
	
$(document).ready(function () {
	...	
    $("#btnChangeColour").click(function () {
		// No error when doing this but the implementation won't be affected.		
		$.fn.greenify.debug = function(text) {
            console.log("Am I able to do this? " + text);
        };
		...
	});
});


When providing plugin options, keep things simple. Don't force people to have to think too much about how to control things and follow what the jQuery library tends to do e.g. for controlling animation speed, it might seem like a good idea to have options like "fast" and "slow" available which could be handled in code like this:

var delay = 0;

switch(settings.delayValue) {
	case "fast":
		delay = 100;
		break;
		
	case "slow":
		delay = 500;
		break;
	
	default:
		delay = 300;
		break;
}

but this causes problems. Firstly there is a lot of extra code required to parse the value. Secondly the code will mushroom as more values are added. Thirdly, the built-in jQuery functions tend to allow values to simply be specified in milliseconds reducing the code required and allowing arbitrary values to be specified easily.
